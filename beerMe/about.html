        <p>Greetings! We are BeerMe, a new alcTech company hoping to make the world a better place through dynamic pop culture based alcoholism driven applications. From our humble beginnings in a Somalian war cult, we fought, clawed, grenaded and red rovered our way to where we are now. Our company was born of multiple The Office marathons fueled by Red Bull and Zima. Since then, our tastes have grown along with our company and now we work in the hyper exclusive world of craft beer, where we live by the saying "May your pretentiousness reach as high as pipe smoke."</p>
        <p>Thank you for being apart of our journey. We are Josh, Kaitlin, Kim, Derek, and David.</p>
        <p>PS We kind of miss the whole cult thing, so if anyone is a charismatic ideologue, we are looking!</p>
